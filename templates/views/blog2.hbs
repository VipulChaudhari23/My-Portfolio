        Li-Fi Technogy
        April 03, 2021
        Li-Fi (also written as LiFi) is a wireless communication technology which utilizes light to transmit data and
        position between devices.
        Better Feature For Us!!
        Nowadays, the most Important thing is this running World is INTERNET & DATA. In Today’s Digital Society we use
        the technology which is used to send and receive the data wirelessly. We use the
        internet to do every small thing in our day-to-day life. No one from us uses the hardware to transfer the data,
        I w
        remember when I used my pen drie(PD) or CD at the last time to transfer the things. Now,we’ll see the Great
        Technology introduced by Harald aas during 2011.
        At present,for the time being : :
        In the Present situation we use Wi-Fi as a wireless networking technology that allows devices such as computers
        (laptops and desktops), mobile devices (smartphones and wearables), and other equipment (printers and video
        cameras) to
        interface with the Internet. And in Wi-Fi Internet connectivity occurs through a wireless router. Where data Is
        being transmitted by “Radio waves”.
        On the other hand We all know that the Environment is getting harmed by the
        intensive Radio Waves Government to India is giving knowledge about that daily, from the medium of Movies(Robot
        2.0), environment campines, etc…
        To avoid this and to make world more faster the new technology has been introduced
        i.e. “Li-Fi”
        Li-Fi
        Li-Fi (light fidelity) works on VLC principle in simple terms we can say that it is a light based Wi-Fi
        technology. In today’s World we like everything in the form of multitasking. So why should light be single
        tasking? In this case the Li-Fi technology transmits data in the form of visible Light using the LED source. So
        the House LED bulbs and LED lamps which are used as a light source can also be used to transmit the data.
        FACTS : :
        At the starting of this technical world there was a device called Bluetooth which was the very first device used
        to transfer the data from one device to another. We use that technology so many days for data transferring. I
        remember when I was using this bluetooth for the transmission of data it would take 2 to 3 hr to transfer one
        movie of some files of about 700 to 10wrrfw00 mb. The connection was also weak and was getting disconnected many
        times during transmission and it was tferfgaking too much battery and
        also the main thing devices which arerrafae having a role in the process of transmission need to be close to

        Li-Fi
        Li-Fi (light fidelity) works on VLC principle in simple terms we can say that it is a light based Wi-Fi
        technology. In today’s World we like everything in the form of multitasking. So why should light be single
        tasking? In this case the Li-Fi technology transmits data in the form of visible Light using the LED source. So
        the House LED bulbs and LED lamps which are used as a light source can also be used to transmit the data.
        FACTS : :
        At the starting of this technical world there was a device called Bluetooth which was the very first device used
        to transfer the data from one device to another. We use that technology so many days for data transferring. I
        remember when I was using this bluetooth for the transmission of data it would take 2 to 3 hr to transfer one
        movie of some files of about 700 to 10wrrfw00 mb. The connection was also weak and was getting disconnected many
        times during transmission and it was tferfgaking too much battery and
        also the main thing devices which arerrafae having a role in the process of transmission need to be close to
        each
        other.I w

        Now also we use bluetooth but only to connect the
        Audio(headphone,earphone,etc..) not to transfer the data.but, it was very useful at that time span. Now it will
        not work…!
        After that the new technology came under use was Wi-Fi the wireless radio wave communication.which we are using
        today in our day-to-day life. When it came to know there is a technology named wi-fi which is faster than
        bluetooth the whole world starteeerafjgfjwagjkwghd wjhdbgwjhdgjbfechcheabceakhcb ehgeuk heukrfh ejkr

        using that very fast. Because that was the need of the society at the starting.but, there were some problems
        that i also faced which were the (1)costing of Wi-Fi. To connect to the Wi-Fi at our word place we need to Buy
        the Router and the lan cable from the Wi-Fi connection center. Which is 4 to 5k and the Wi-Fi is a prepaid
        service
        based system in the limited time span. WI-Fi work on the principle of Radio Waves So it can cross the wall’s
        because of this our network was not safe any buddy was able to connect that connection for free by hacking the
        password. The speed is also slow for the present period. As we all are coming in online mode for everything and
        in this
        Covid-19 period almost everything was started online( On one call ).

        This Radio wave environment is also getting harm and the Animals also by use of both Wi-fi or CD drive. By the
        radiation of that radio waves everyone is having something of a problem.
        And the common method is by using The PD pen drives. An external hardware device is used to save and transfer
        the data but it has a limited space like 4gb, 8gb,16gb, etc...now we will see why li-Fi is better…?
        Why is Li-Fi better ?

        As we have an overlook on all the types of transmitting methods i feel like the Li-Fi is much better from all of
        those because it has the speed which is 10 times more than Wi-Fi. It does not need any external device like
        Rouyer and all..it is limited to the area like the area which the LED light covers only in that area the
        connection will be supplied not like an Wi-Fi. Li-Fi,the communications cannot penetrate through walls and
        doors. And Also we would think like if we want to work at night then we need to keep light on? But, the answer
        is because we can manage the brightness of the LED
        light at very low intensity and we can use Li-Fi at very high speed. The Li-Fi market was projected to have a
        compound annual growth rate of 82% from 2013 to 2018 and to be worth over $6 billion per year by 2018. However,
        the market has not developed as such and Li-Fi remains with a niche market, mainly for technology evaluation.
        Li-Fi has the advantage of being useful in electromagnetic sensitive areas
        such as in aircraft cabins, hospitals and nuclear power plants without causing electromagnetic interference.
        Both Wi-Fi and Li-Fi transmit data over the electromagnetic spectrum, but whereas Wi-Fi utilizes radio
        waves, Li-Fi uses visible, ultraviolet, and infrared light. While the US Federal
        Communications Commission has warned of a potential spectrum crisis because Wi-Fi is close to full capacity,
        Li-Fi has almost no
        limitations on capacity. The visible light spectrum is 10,000 times larger than the entire radio frequency
        spectrum. Researchers have reached data rates of over 224 Gbit/s,
        which was much faster than typical fast broadband in 2013. Li-Fi is expected to be ten times cheaper than
        Wi-Fi.[7] Short range, low reliability and high installation costs are the potential downsides.
        Working:
        It works similar to,light emitting Process we see any LED light source, if we provide a constant current to the
        source it provides you the constant illumination or brightness which is digital 1. So as we change the current
        that is flowing through this LED bulb the illumination or the brightness of the bulb will be minimum which is
        digital 0.
        So in this way by flickering the LED light source very rapidly in the form of 0’s and 1’s we can transmit the
        data and this flickering is happening at million times we cannot see it by our naked eyes. This principle is
        used to transmit the data wirelessly using this LI-Fi technology.
        Now we will see the schematic of a Li-Fi transmitter and the receiver system. So as the data is coming from the
        web server or the internet, first it will go to the modem it will provide it necessary modulation to the
        incoming data stream. Then this data is fed to the LDE driver which changes the driving current for this LED
        according to
        the incoming streaming data. At the receiver end the optically receiving data is first converted into the
        electrical signal using the photo receiver or photodiode and then after signal conditioning the data is fed to
        the computer or laptop. based system in the limited time span. WI-Fi work on the principle of Radio Waves So it

        Neural Networks’ Smart Fact: The Joint Creating A Photo Is Belonged To All

A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a 
set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates.


By Dave Gardner,

Neural networks are becoming smarter and smarter, almost like an avalanche. This is especially true
in the realm of research on hybrid cars and other advanced computerized devices.Industry insiders also 
see the benefits of AI technology. Automotive giant Ford recently added advanced driver assistance systems
and safety services to its vehicles.
According to Reuters, the company reported at least one accident-free month since the beginning of 2015.
That fact was also made public by the Center for Auto Safety.
Another figure that emerged from the Center is that the auto industry has not reported a single fatality
 that could have been prevented by safety systems and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems.



 
The reason for this is that Ford's AI is now supporting semi-autonomous and autonomous driving
 technologies. It uses a combination of active and passive elements. The key to all of this is
  "learning," which is when a computer uses algorithms to mimic the human brain.


Now-a-days :-

If neural networks were human brains, they would be considered truly "intelligent."
Neural networks are not only growing in number and range of applications, they are also learning
 faster than humans.
Researchers from the University of Central Florida in Orlando conducted a study last year that showed

 human neural networks outperform even top professional human chess players. The neural networks are 
 less predictable than human experts, according to the findings.
Prof. Srinivasa Narasimhan, one of the researchers on the UCF study, told IEEE
Spectrum, "They don't have good old errors. Human experts have big errors and neural networks don't, 
so they come up with more clever ways to do things. It's like the experts are the underdogs, trying
 to defeat the computers."
Companies like Nvidia are using neural networks and other AI technology to build neural networks 
that can be trained to do a wide range of things. One use is to help create
"machines that can do what we want."

This is the power of AI, and companies like Nvidia are tapping into the power. At CES last month, 
Nvidia revealed its AI computer chip, the TensorRT 4. This is an advanced version of the same chip
 that Nvidia introduced in 2015.
The main difference between the TensorRT 4 and its predecessor is in how the AI functions. The
 new chip runs machine learning algorithms 10 times faster, and it is also more flexible in how
  it can run.
 


Advantages of Neural Networks For Auditing-in BPM, HIPAA & IoT



Pervasive monitoring systems are a good approach to identify assets at risk (ARW).
However, it does not provide enough information about changes in asset status. In addition, the
 monitoring systems use rule-based detection, so it might not be feasible to automate for unexpected
  incidents. This is where neural networks can come to the rescue. For example, when alerts are
   triggered from changing state (system) state (resource usage, latency, latency thresholds),
    a trained deep learning network can start to predict the signal as opposed to relying on
     random detection. Deep learning provides a more effective and efficient neural network
      and only has 5% of false positive rate as compared to a random network. The key benefits
       of neural networks over rule-based detection are intuitive state monitoring, not only the ARW.


Benefits of a Neural Network



•	Inclusive and Integrated approach: Natural language processing (NLP) combined with automatic
 text analysis facilitates automatically and quickly identifying the sensor data. This greatly
  simplifies integration and enables seamless use for most environments and applications.


•	Automatic learning: Deep learning allows the network to learn as it is trained. It can learn
 the detection process, handling of alerts, and spotting the process errors. The
network can even learn its own policies and will be able to operate in a multi-robot team for
 performing complex tasks.
 
•	Strong and Simplified models: Neural networks are able to learn complex objects by
 themselves.


Types of Neural Networks

I’ve shown that by leveraging the power of basic math it is possible to build networks for just
 about any number of data. In this article, I’ll dig into how those simple networks can be
  utilized, how to implement them, and explore their performance properties.
The simplest operation in a neural network is to count the number of consecutive pixel values
 that pass between successive. Each network is composed of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64,
128, or 256 neurons.

Now I understand that it’s possible to manually build a network with the first kind of
 neurons, but I don’t recommend it. The command line is not your friend, and for advanced settings 
 it is impossible to interactively control the parameters of the network.

 



Let's look at the basic mathematics involved.

●		Complex numbers :- To begin with, this network must have at least some input data.
 What kind of input data you use is entirely up to you, but it doesn’t have to be very complex.
  In a way, it’s almost exactly like your average Joe writing a computer program. You can add 
  words and sentences to the input, change the color of a neuron, and even create an emitter. 
  But the result will still be a digital signal. Neural networks, on the other hand, receive
   digital signals.



●		Inputs :- Inputs are given in a number of values in order. The number of values the
 network should take on is the number of neurons in the network.
There are a few reasons to keep the number of input values as low as possible. As mentioned,
 it’s important to use basic math. It also helps the neural network to perform more effectively.
  A network that has too many inputs will get stuck in an
infinite loop. Too few inputs and it will perform poorly and incorrectly detect the input.
●	Nodes :- The nodes in a neural network are the difference between the input and the output.
 If you’re familiar with binary, it’s just a mathematical representation of 0 and 1.


●	Residual neurons :-Residual neurons form the heart of a neural network. When a node fires,
 one neuron in the residual layer sends the color value it used to be firing to the neurons that
  were not activated. The residual layer of the network is where you can control which neurons are
   being used.
 
●	Training :- Because we had 11 input values and it took them 8 to output 1, I simply multiplied
 the input values. I also used the same 3 neurons in the red and blue regions.


Future of Neural Networks :-

Blockchain Blocked Unblock Follow Following Sep 12, 2017

Today, we can write a blockchain transaction and get the same result. But tomorrow what can
 we expect from blockchain technology? First, blockchain technology will allow us to use digital
  currencies.
For example, ethereum has its own currency which can be traded against the U.S. dollar. This
 is an example of innovation in finance. The developers of blockchain technology can make smart
  contracts on the blockchain, and create smart financial
instruments. For example, a Smart Contract can include a chain of articles where some function
 is performing automatically. If a competitor of a company fails to fulfill his order, then the
  contract automatically executes to punish the competitor.
